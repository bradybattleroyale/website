<p>The year is 2045. Tom Brady has just claimed his 22nd super bowl ring. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers defeated the Cleveland Crunchy Chestnuts in the super bowl 64&ndash;44.</p>
<p>Brady stands atop the Rocky steps in Philly, wearing his old Patriots Jersey and a winter beanie. He holds a microphone, addressing a sparse crowd of curious bystanders.</p>

<p class="quote">Welcome fantasy managers... welcome to your ultimate challenge.</p>
<p class="quote">As you very well know, my age is approaching 70 and it has come time for me to choose a successor to be the next emperor of football.</p>
<p>About one fourth of the crowd turns towards the quarterback and begins to listen, the rest are looking at their phones and not paying attention.</p>
<p class="quote">This is why I have created the most devious challenge. Only the bravest, luckiest managers will pass. The most fortunate of all will receive my blessings and be crowned emperor.</p>
<p class="quote"></p>
<p>At this point, you find yourself among a small audience of a dozen or so people that has formed nearby the speaker. He addresses you directly.</p>
<p class="quote">Do you have what it takes to earn Fantasy Favor? Or are you a Fantasy Fool? Come, join the fray of battle with me, one last time!</p>
<p>Brady reaches into his pocket and pulls out a bunch of envelopes and hands them out to each of you. As he is handing them out, a curious child wanders in from the background.</p>
<p>Brady distributes the envelopes, and with one left, approaches the curious child. He reaches his arm out and offers the final envelope to the child.</p>
<p class="quote">"Ah ah ah, this one's for me."<span class="non-italic"> A trick, Brady pulls back the envelope with a smug smile and holds it close to his body. </span></p>
<p>You open the envelope and extract the paper inside:</p>

		<li>Each week, lowest scoring team is eliminated and their players are slapped to waivers for the remaining managers to fight over.</li>
		<li>Waiver priority goes by a blind bidding system. When you make a claim, you attach a bid of waiver bucks. Highest bidder gets the player. You have 1,000 waiver bucks for the whole season. Spend wisely!</li>
		<li>The last remaining team wins and the manager is crowned emperor!</li>

<p>Brady opens his envelope and starts laughing to himself, thinking of the crazy league that he has created.</p>

<h2>League rules</h2>

<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Every week, the team that scores the lowest amount of points on that week is eliminated and their players are slapped to waivers by a league admin.</li>
		<li>The highest scoring team on that week is awarded immunity for the next week. That means they do not get eliminated if they score lowest. If an immune team scores lowest, the 2nd lowest scoring team is eliminated.</li>
		<li>League ends and emperor is crowned when one team remains.</li>
		<li>Players will be slapped on Tuesday morning. Place your waiver claims before waivers process on Wednesday morning. After waivers process, any unclaimed players can be claimed for free.</li>
		<li>When you make a waiver claim, you must place a bid of waiver bucks. When waivers process, the highest bidder gets priority on their claim. You have 1,000 waiver bucks to last you the whole season. The bid is blind, meaning other managers cannot see your bid until after waivers process. The minimum bid is $1.</li>

		<br/>
		<li><strong>Note</strong>: You can trade waiver bucks or immunity. Just tell the league admin.</li>
		<li><strong>Exception</strong>: No eliminiations will occur on weeks 1 and 2. The first elimination occurs after week 3 games. The player with the lowest total score over the first 3 weeks will be eliminated.</li>
		<li><strong>Exception</strong>: When 3 or fewer players remain, there is no immunity.</li>

<h2>Scoring</h2>

Highly customized scoring rules.

Be sure to check the 2021 "<a href="https://fantasy.espn.com/football/leaders?leagueId=855735757&lineupSlot=4&scoringPeriodId=0&statSplit=lastSeason">scoring leaders</a>" under this league's scoring settings. You will get an idea of what type of player is valuable to draft. (Hint: Braxton Berrios was a WR1 last year). Also, keep in mind that ESPN does not make projections for kick returns, so kick return players may be misplaced on the player list if you sort by projection.

<h3>Passing</h3>
Accurate QBs are rewarded. Earn points per completion and lose points for incompletions. Bigger penalties for int and sack, bigger reward for touchdowns.
