<p>In the heart of a sprawling metropolis stood a magnificent football stadium unlike any other. In this grand arena, dreams came alive, and stories of triumph and heart ache were written. The roar of the crowd could be heard echoing even from miles away. At the pinnacle of the stadium, high above the fervent crowds was a private room. A room imbued with magic and history, where the boundaries between reality and myth blurred. Here stood the Emperor of football's sanctum. Emperor Alex, an enigmatic figure known for his unparalleled knowledge of the game, and extremely good fantasy football luck, sits atop his throne. He wore a coat which bore the emblems of legendary teams, past, present, and future teams to come, and the emperor's crown, a pink beanie, atop his head. His eyes were fixed upon the game below, tracing the ball as it hurtled across the emerald field that lay beneath a sunset-filled sky.</p>

</div>

<p>At Alex's side sat Tom Brady, the legendary quarterback. After passing the title of Emperor to Alex, Brady remained as a trusted advisor and fantasy commissioner. Alex's gaze drifted towards the sidelines, where a group of nine other people with front row seats were furiously mock drafting on their phones. Despite their proximity to the action on the field, they were fixated with the competition unfolding on their phones. Alex nodded and smiled to himself, impressed. "Brady, see to it that these nine are presented with my challenge." Alex said. He watched as Brady made his way down the stands to the group of mock drafters, greeting them then escorting them up into the sanctum. Brady announces to everyone that the emperor has invited some of the bravest and luckiest managers to vie for his position as emperor. It is a challenge that Alex devised for himself to prove that he really is the bravest and luckiest fantasy manager.</p>

<p>Brady hands each an envelope containing an invite to BRADY'S BATTLE ROYALE. Will Alex prove the strongest again and defend his throne, or will another manager surpass all others to claim the emperor's crown which is a pink beanie? Be a part of the story in BRADY'S BATTLE ROYALE 2023.</p>
<!-- 
<p>You open the envelope and extract the paper inside:</p>

<div style="background: white; color:  black; padding: 2em; max-width: 1200px;">
	<h3>WELCOME TO TOM BRADY'S BATTLE ROYALE. </a></h3>
	<ul style="background: white; color:  black; padding: 1em;">
		Every week, the lowest scoring team is eliminated from the league. Their players are slapped to waivers for the remaining managers to fight over. Managers bid on waiver players using their budget of waiver bucks for the season. The last remaining team wins and the manager is crowned emperor! Spend wisely and try your best to survive!
	</ul>
	<br/>
</div>

<p>Brady opens his envelope and starts laughing to himself, thinking of the crazy league that he has created.</p>

<h2>League rules</h2>

<p class="newfor2023">Changes for 2023 are highlighted in orange below</p>

<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Each week, the lowest scoring team of that week is eliminated for the season. Their players are dropped to the free agent pool.</li>
		<li>The highest scoring team on that week is awarded immunity for the next week. That means they do not get eliminated if they score lowest. If they score lowest, the 2nd lowest scoring team is eliminated.</li>
		<li>League ends and emperor is crowned when one team remains.</li>
		<li>Waivers use a blind bidding system ("FAAB"). When you make a claim, you attach a bid of waiver bucks. Highest bidder gets the player. You have 1,000 waiver bucks for the whole season. Spend wisely!</li>
		

		<br/>
		<li><strong>Exception</strong>: No elimination on weeks 1 and 2. The first elimination occurs after week 3 games. The player with the lowest cumulative score over the first 3 weeks is eliminated.</li>
		<li><strong>Exception</strong>: When 3 or fewer players remain, there is no immunity.</li>
		<li class="newfor2023"><strong>Exception (New for 2023)</strong>: When 2 players remain, the team that just got eliminated is not dropped to free agency. Assemble your strongest roster before then!</li>
		<br/>
		<li><strong>Note</strong>: The minimum bid of waiver bucks is $1. After waivers process, any unclaimed players can be added for free.</li>
		<li><strong>Note</strong>: You can trade waiver bucks or immunity. Just tell the league admin.</li>
